  faq:
  - q: Where can I learn more?
    a: |
      The [Pilot Hubs Documentation](https://pilot.2i2c.org) has all of the information that you need to use the hub, as well as information about the deployment technology.

  - q: What is a Jupyter Notebook?
    a: |
      [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) is an open-source web
      application that allows you to create and share documents that contain
      live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include:
      data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical
      modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

  - q: What is JupyterHub?
    a: |
      [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) brings
      the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to
      computational environments and resources without burdening the users with
      installation and maintenance tasks. Users - including students,
      researchers, and data scientists - can get their work done in their own
      workspaces on shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system
      administrators.

  - q: Who can use this service?
    a: |
      This JupyterHub service is open to anyone that a hub administrator has approved.
      Generally this means instructors and students. As this
      is a proof-of-concept service, students should ensure they are backing up
      their notebooks regularly if they are using this service for course
      activities.
